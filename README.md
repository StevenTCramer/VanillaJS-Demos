# VanillaJS-Demos : A Simple Web Developer's Notebook

Content
-------

This is a notebook written in plain HTML. It is a basic guide to building web sites using only HTML, JavaScript,
and CSS (without any external libraries or frameworks, such as jQuery).

Sometimes we become so dependent on our Web UI framework that we forget how to do these things is plain HTML and
JavaScript, so this notebook can be a handy reference if you need to refresh your memory on some of the fundamentals.

This notebook contains:

* A list of all HTML tags, with quick links to W3Schools and Mozilla Developer Network for more detail.
* A list of basic DOM operations showing how they can be accomplished using pure JavaScript without jQuery.
* A list of YouTube videos about JavaScript recorded by Doug Crockford. This is a well known video series and very
  useful for helping newcomers get up to speed on JavaScript.
* A variety of HTML page templates for creating new web pages quickly.  
* A list of other handy web resources for web developers including sites that cover VanillaJS, online developer tools,
  content delivery networks, etc.
  
Installation
------------

Option 1: To use the files directly from your browser:

* Clone this repository to your local computer
* Using your browser, simply open the index.html file in the root of this repo. Navigate and enjoy. (Tip: On Crhome, press Ctrl-O to open the File Open dialog).

Option 2: Configuring a web server to serve the pages:

* Clone this repository to your local computer
* Configure you web server of choice to serve the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. Since this notebook does not require any
  back-end server support, it is not necessary to configure NodeJS, PHP, ASP, ASP.NET, JSP or any other back-end page handlers.
  Generally you just need to point your browser to the root directory and assign it a port number.
