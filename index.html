      This is a notebook written in raw HTML. I wrote this notebook to give me a quick place to
      demonstrate and remember the principles of writing web sites using raw HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
      and most especially WITHOUT using jQuery.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of yet, I have not sylized this notebook, so I please excuse me if it looks really ugly.
      This notebook is not (yet) intended to showcase my skills in UI/UX design. It is only meant
      to demo web development skills distilled to its essential form.

            It seems that I only use about a dozen or so tags on a daily basis, but some day I'm going
            to take the time to memorize all HTML tags so that I can stop looking them up when I need them.
            But in the meantime, here's a list of all of them.
